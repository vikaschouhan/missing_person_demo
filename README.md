Missing person demo website using aws rekognition
--------------------------------------------------
A demo webapp to search for missing people using aws rekognition.
Personal data for missing people is entered into the website’s database by an operator using a form on the website itself. 
Now, whenever a person’s image is uploaded via the search page, the website searches for that person in it’s image database and comes out with a list of all matching entries along with their personal information and other metadata.
This website uses amazon’s “rekognition” engine for it’s backend to search for matching candidates.
